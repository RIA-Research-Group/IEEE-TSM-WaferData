# IEEE-TSM-WaferData
Wafer Bin Map data used in "A Graph-Theoretic Approach for Spatial Filtering and Its Impact on Mixed-type Spatial Pattern Recognition in Wafer Bin Maps"

This repository contains the full data used in the numerical experiments of our paper titled: A. Ezzat, Liu, S., Hochbaum, D., and Ding, Y., "A Graph-Theoretic Approach for Spatial Filtering and Its Impact on Mixed-type Spatial Pattern Recognition in Wafer Bin Maps," IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing, 2021, 34(2), 194-206.  

The dataset was extracted and processed from a larger dataset, which can be cited at: M.-J. Wu, J.-S. R. Jang, and J.-L. Chen, “Wafer map failure pattern recognition and similarity ranking for large-scale data sets,” IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing, vol. 28, no. 1, pp. 1–12, 2014.
