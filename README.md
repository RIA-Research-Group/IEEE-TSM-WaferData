# IEEE-TSM-WaferData
All Wafer maps are downloaded from the full dataset available at Prof. Roger Jang's public repository: http://mirlab.org/dataSet/public/ 
which is described in detail in: Wu et al., “Wafer map failure pattern recognition and similarity ranking for large-scale data sets,” 
IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing, vol. 28, no. 1, pp. 1–12, 2014. 
 
The R code imports and visualizes the 12 wafer maps, written by Ahmed Aziz Ezzat (aziz.ezzat@rutgers.edu) -- Last edited in FEB 2021
and is used in the following paper: Ezzat et al., "A Graph-Theoretic Approach for Spatial Filtering and Its Impact on Mixed-type Spatial Pattern Recognition in Wafer Bin Maps,"
IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing, 2021, 34(2), 194-206.
